Styling backgrounds can be a chore, so settle for the defaults instead! Pass the React CSS objects returned to the style prop of the react component.

A note on using flexboxes
---

All children of the div tag prescriped the property `display: flex` will be treated as items of the flexbox.

For more details on what it means to be an item of a flexbox I'd recommend the article: https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/.

Try not to implement nested flexboxes as this causes confusion.
